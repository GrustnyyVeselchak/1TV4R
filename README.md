# 1TV4R - The first test VITE for React.js

Welcome to 1TV4R, a repository created to explore VITE for React.js and to conduct tests related to the IDBS project.

## About
This repository was my first experiment with VITE to understand its functionality and integration into the React.js framework. Primarily intended for training purposes and is a testing ground. It is currently a single page application with a dropzone component. Users can upload DOCX files, which are then displayed on the browser page. Additionally, there is a button to download the converted DOCX content to HTML format.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser.
